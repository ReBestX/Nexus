# Nexus-Social

Welcome to the Nexus Social media platform! This is my inaugural PHP project üôå, and I'm excited to announce that Nexus is now live and active.

Throughout the development journey, I've harnessed an array of cutting-edge technologies and tools to bring Nexus to life. Here's a glimpse into what powers the platform:

üöÄ **Frontend**: The user interface is crafted using HTML, CSS with the dynamic Tailwind CSS framework, and JavaScript. The user experience is elevated by the integration of SweetAlert2 for interactive alerts and ScrollReveal.js for captivating scroll-based animations.

‚öôÔ∏è **Backend**: Behind the scenes, Nexus is driven by the robust PHP programming language. The essential PHPMailer library seamlessly manages email communication. MySQL takes care of efficient database management, while AJAX (jQuery) ensures smooth and seamless data handling.
